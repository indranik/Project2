### Topic 

Reston Transit Sation Areas Development Tracking

Reston is a fast developing area within Fairfax County, VA. The impetus for the development  in this area is the recent extension of Washington Metro. 

A 2014 Planning Study replanned this area to transform this area to include a virbant mix of uses, with the majority of future development focussed near the station locations. The master Plan created three new Transit Station Areas (TSA). Each TSA is futher divided into Districts and Sub-Districts. The master Plan has guidence as to how specific areas within these TSA redevelop.

This tool will help the County staff and citizens to monitor the current and future development potential/activity for any given area in the TSAs and analyse if the Plan's longterm goals are met.In addition, this tool will let the users  to engage in scenario building activity to understand the impacts of specific development plans. 



### Dataset

We are using Fairfax County's Tax Records, Comprehensive Plan Buildout and development pipeline data. The data is stored in csv, json format. We are in process of acquiring shapefiles and potentially use it for our visualization.
The data can be found @ resources/data/



### Inspiring visualizations

Interactive web pages are a fun way to show cause and effect. We are looking at flowingdata sites such as :
